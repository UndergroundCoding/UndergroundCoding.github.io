Today I started a blog. I'm not sure if it will be program specific, or dev specific, or specific at
all. I don't even know if I will keep itreading, but I will at least write and commit this entry.

This blog is (will be) hosted on github, initially as a markdown file but later as a website 
(through github pages).

Anyway I've been wanting to list my struggles; my learnings;-and-; my victories. It is important to
anchor your path by remembering the beginnings.
