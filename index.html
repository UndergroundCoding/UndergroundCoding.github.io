    <h2 id="episode-1-i-start-a-blog">Episode 1: I Start a blog</h2>
    <p>Today I started a blog. I'm not sure if it will be program specific, or dev specific, or specific at
all. I don't even know if I will keep itreading, but I will at least write and commit this entry.</p>
    <p>This blog is (will be) hosted on github, initially as a markdown file but later as a website
(through github pages).</p>
    <p>Anyway I've been wanting to list my struggles; my learnings;-and-; my victories. It is important to
anchor your path by remembering the beginnings.</p>
    <h2 id="episode-2-a-tale-of-libccrtp">Episode 2: A Tale of libccrtp.</h2>
    <p>The project started. I set out to work with what seems like the only library for RTP and RTSP
protocol. GNU's ccRTP library is exactly what I need, but in C++ instead of Java. However, it does
have a benefit over any Java product: it will be much lighter, and portable. Since it is my
intention to have Radio run on various types of devices, even very small one, and to have various
servers on a cloud, a lightweight program will help keep costs low and provide easy scability. In
this fashion I decided to build a C++, Linux program.</p>
    <p>I decide OK, ccrtp it is. I hit Download from GNU's website and what I downloaded was the source
code. It did not dawn on me that the source was not the binaries, and I simply assumed I had to
compile it.</p>
    <p>Long story short, I have to go through hours, days, of learning how to compile from source on Linux.
I learn about <code>configure</code>, I <em>start</em> to learn about <code>cmake</code>, and I spend  a very long time trying to
find the dependencies for compiling libccrtp. It took me very long to find and download
libcommoncpp, libucommon, gcrypt, etc. I finally get a handle of <code>apt</code>, learn the purpose of
<code>configure</code>, and get <code>Makefile</code> to compile successfully.</p>
    <p>Then, late at night in bed, feeling proud of myself and finally ready to start actually coding, I
come across the thought that "maybe, just maybe, I should search for the ccrtp's <em>binary</em>." What I
found was both funny and disappointing:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>$ apt search libccrtp

libccrtp-dev/stable 2.0.9-2.3 amd64

libccrtp2v5/stable,now 2.0.9-2.3 amd64 [installed,auto-removable]

    </pre>
    <p>Whatever. At least I learned a lot along the way.</p>
