# UnderGround Coding

If you are reading this, changes are that 1) you got here by accident and 2) you don't really know 
what you are looking for.

Regardless of how you might have stumbled into this pointless endeavour, the solution is the same:
either hit `Back` on your browser until you feel safe or visit the [Underground Blog](blog), 
where the pointlessness of this project strectches far beyond necessary. 

A little more text to improve aesthetic and the appearance of an elegant, content-rich page.

This is another pointless paragraph, but at tgis point I have realized I dont know how to end the 
page... Do I finish it like a letter, which a `Best regards, xoxo`, or do I add a typical Copyright
statement, even though I don't even know what it means?

Honestly, at this point I don't think paragraph 3 is needed anymore. This page now is no longer just
a clever joke to redirect to my blog, but has become a _actually_ pointless, bloated mess, that I
just can't seem to find out how to end.

I guess I'll just end it here, then...
